1. Introduction

    Users using the server can communicate with each other using a few commands.

2. Goals for this week

    1) It manages data by connecting MongoDB and Python.

    2) Connect to school flip server and try port forwarding.

3. What you accomplished

The connection to the MongoDB server was successful and I can connect to the school flip server.

4. How this compares with your plan

    4 hours
    1) When connecting to the MongoDB server and running vscode, no error occurs
    , but data is not actually inserted into the MongoDB data collection.

    2) I can connect to the school flip server
    , but I need python 3.7 or higher to use the pymongo library for using mongodb.

5. Plan for next week
    Connecting data management with MongoDB and port forwarding are important parts of this project. First of all, I will correct the error on this and I will introduce the Rank system to the current system.

6. What is blocking you/help needed 
    I wonder why data is not inserted into MongoDB data and whether Python 3.7 or higher can be downloaded to the school flip server.
